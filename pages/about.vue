    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Never stop learning.</h2>
    <p>
        Born in the <Highlight>early 90s</Highlight>, I got my first computer when I was 6. When I played the first
        video games on it, I was wondering
        <Highlight>"Somebody must have told the computer what it should do — how does that even work?"</Highlight>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then this was the question that motivated me to learn as much as possible about it. My friends continued
        playing video games — <Highlight>I started to build my own</Highlight>.
    </p>
    <p>
        During school I tried to attend every computer science class possible. That made me learn
        <Highlight>C++</Highlight> with 12 and <Highlight>Java</Highlight> with 16.
    </p>
    <p>
        After school, thinks looked different — my interests changed and I started working in the
        <Highlight>event industry</Highlight> as a <Highlight>lighting designer</Highlight>. I toured the world with
        <Highlight>artists</Highlight>, I lit up <Highlight>corporate events</Highlight> and
        <Highlight>festivals</Highlight>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I never forgot about the old times when I tried to figure out how computers work. So in
        <Highlight>2016</Highlight> I started studying <Highlight>computer science</Highlight> to acquire that knowledge
        once and for all.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <Highlight>2020</Highlight> Covid hit hard. I financed my studies freelancing in lighting design during that
        time and as the live industry shut down, my profession was useless all of a sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point I had already learned the ins and outs of software development. I had no degree yet but I only
        missed out on math, theoretical computer science and the like. I always was more the hands-on type of guy
        anyway. So I started focussing on software development, quit university and got myself some dirty hands.
